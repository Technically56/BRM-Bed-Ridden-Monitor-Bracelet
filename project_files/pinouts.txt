Board: Raspberry Pi Pico W

Connections:
GPIO4: MAX30100 Sensor Board SDA and BMI160 Sensor Board SDA(in paralel)
GPIO5: MAX30100 Sensor Board SCL and BMI160 Sensor Board SCL(in paralel)
GPIO26: OUT PIN OF THE LM35
GPIO27: YELLOW Wire of the Grove GSR Sensor
All GND and VCC ports on the sensors should be connected to ground and 3.3v terminal of the pico. Additionally, the SAO pin on the BMI160 Sensor Board
must be connected to GND for the sensor to function.
External power sources can be connected to the VSYS pin of the raspberry pi pico. The tp4056 board is used alongside an 18650 battery for the demo.

TROUBLESHOOT:
Any and all problems faced during boot can be resolved by a manual restart. The wifi and the password sections should be modified accordingly for the prototype to work.
